Class: Tutor notes
    Name should be the first and last name, no middle initial

    Subjects will be capatalized possible options can include: FILL THIS IN LATER
        For now we will use: Geometry, English, Spanish, History

    Avail is formatted as a list with entry 0 being M (monday) and entry 6 being Su (sunday)
        Everything should be formatted in 24 hour clock style such that this is easier to code. I will try to make it such that this isn't used in the GUI
        If the start or stop times respond with unavailable then they are unavailable for the entire day
            Example:
            M:4pm-6pm Tu:5:30pm-8:30pm W:Unavailable Etc.
            Avail={'M':{'Start':1600,'End':1800},'Tu':{'Start':1730,'End':2030}, 'W':{'Start':'Un','End':'Un'} Etc....}
            Then, if I wanted to, say, get this tutors Tuesday Start time it would be
            Avail['Tu']['Start']

    Sessions will be dealt with at a later time
